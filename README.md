## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://rossfahan.github.io/weather-dashboard)

This is a simple weather application that allows a user to get the current weather and 5 day forcast of a city. The applicaiton uses OpenWeather API to fetch the data, and also stores search history to local storage so that a user may easily access previous searches through the click of a button.
